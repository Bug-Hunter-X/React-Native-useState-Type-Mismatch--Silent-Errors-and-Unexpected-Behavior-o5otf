This error occurs when using the `useState` hook in React Native and you try to update the state with a value that is different from the previous state's type.  For example, if your state is initially a number, and you try to update it with a string, you might encounter this issue.  React Native may not explicitly throw an error message, but you might encounter unexpected behavior in your app, such as crashes or UI rendering problems.  This is often subtle and difficult to track down.
