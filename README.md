# React Native useState Type Mismatch: Silent Errors and Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in React Native applications involving type mismatches when updating state using the `useState` hook. The problem manifests as unexpected behavior or crashes, often without clear error messages in the console, making debugging challenging. 

## Problem Description

The core issue lies in inadvertently attempting to update the state with a value of a different type than initially declared.  For example, if the state is initialized as a number, trying to update it with a string can lead to unexpected results. This is because React Native's internal state management might not handle the type change gracefully, potentially leading to silent failures or incorrect UI rendering.

## Solution

To prevent this, always ensure you are updating the state with a value of the same type as initially declared. Strict type checking, either manually or through TypeScript, is highly recommended.  Input validation can also help catch type mismatches before they reach the state update.
